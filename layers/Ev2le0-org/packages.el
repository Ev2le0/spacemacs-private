;;; Commentary:

;; See the Spacemacs documentation and FAQs for instructions on how to implement
;; a new layer:
;;
;;   SPC h SPC layers RET
;;
;;
;; Briefly, each package to be installed or configured by this layer should be
;; added to `Ev2le0-packages'. Then, for each package PACKAGE:
;;
;; - If PACKAGE is not referenced by any other Spacemacs layer, define a
;;   function `Ev2le0/init-PACKAGE' to load and initialize the package.

;; - Otherwise, PACKAGE is already referenced by another Spacemacs layer, so
;;   define the functions `Ev2le0/pre-init-PACKAGE' and/or
;;   `Ev2le0/post-init-PACKAGE' to customize the package as it is loaded.

;;; Code:

(defconst Ev2le0-org-packages
  '(
	(org :location built-in)
  deft
	))

(defun Ev2le0-org/post-init-org()
  (with-eval-after-load 'org
		(progn 
		  (require 'org-tempo)
		  )
  )
)

(defun Ev2le0-org/post-init-deft()
  (progn
    (setq deft-use-filter-string-for-filename t)
    (setq deft-recursive t)
    (setq deft-extension "org")
    (setq deft-directory deft-dir)))
